# Initial demo

![initial demo](images/demo-drawer-navigation.png)


# Installation

```
npm install @react-navigation/drawer
```


# Installation of extra packages

Para um projeto "Bare", sem o Expo:

In a project with Expo:
```
npx expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-worklets
```

In a project without Expo:
```
npm install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-worklets
```

**OBS:** in the command inserted by the teacher, he did not installled the package "react-native-worklets", but I got the command I passed above [from the updated manual](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/drawer-navigator/?framework=expo#installation)
